# CheckedOutFiles
Check local project/Git folders and see if there are checked-out files. This will be useful to check for any unchecked-in files before a laptop/desktop is wiped, or if an employee is leaving.

To use:

1. Update Data.csv for a list of paths you want to check. It can be recursive which sub-folders within it will also be checked.
2. Run CheckedOutFiles.Console.exe

Checked-out files will be listed on the console window.
